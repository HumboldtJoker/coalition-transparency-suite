# FOIA Template Generation

## Purpose

Generate effective public records requests that maximize compliance while minimizing delays, redactions, and fees. Good FOIA requests are specific, legally grounded, and demonstrate public interest - bad requests are vague, easily denied, or result in excessive costs.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when requesting:
- Contract and procurement documents
- Campaign finance records
- Meeting minutes and correspondence
- Budget and financial documents
- Personnel records and timesheets
- Facility lease agreements
- Cost allocation plans
- Vendor payment records

**Optimization goals:**
- Cite correct legal authority for jurisdiction
- Specify documents precisely (avoid "all records related to...")
- Request electronic formats for analysis
- Establish public interest for fee waivers
- Set reasonable but firm deadlines
- Preserve appeal rights

## Core Principle: Specificity Gets Results

**Why vague requests fail:**
- "All documents related to ABC Company" → thousands of pages, expensive
- "Any correspondence about the contract" → unclear scope, easy denial
- "Information on the lease" → not a records request, treated as question

**Why specific requests succeed:**
- "Contract #2024-567 between County and ABC Company, including bid documents, executed agreement, and payment invoices"
- Clear, limited scope → manageable response
- Specific document types → harder to claim "doesn't exist"
- Defined timeframe → prevents overwhelming volume

## Request Template Structure

### Section 1: Legal Authority Citation

**Identify applicable law:**

**Federal (FOIA - 5 USC § 552):**
```
Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC § 552), I request access to and copies of...
```

**State examples:**

*California (Public Records Act):*
```
Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Government Code §§ 6250-6270), I request...
```

*New York (Freedom of Information Law):*
```
Pursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law (Public Officers Law § 87), I request...
```

*Texas (Public Information Act):*
```
Pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act (Government Code Chapter 552), I request...
```

**Check state-specific requirements:**
- Some states require specific request language
- Deadlines vary (3-10 business days typical)
- Fee structures differ
- Appeal processes vary

### Section 2: Document Specification

**Template structure:**

```
I request the following records:

1. [Specific document type] for [specific subject/entity] covering the period [date range]:
   - [Sub-item a]
   - [Sub-item b]
   - [Sub-item c]

2. [Next document category]...
```

**Examples:**

**Contract request:**
```
1. Contract #2024-789 between [County] and [Vendor Name], including:
   - Complete executed agreement with all amendments
   - Original bid/proposal submitted by vendor
   - All other bids/proposals received (if competitive procurement)
   - Sole-source or emergency justification (if applicable)
   - Staff reports recommending contract award
   - Board/Council meeting minutes authorizing contract

2. Payment records for Contract #2024-789:
   - All invoices submitted by vendor
   - All payments made (check register entries or wire transfers)
   - Any payment holds, disputes, or adjustments
```

**Personnel request:**
```
1. For [Employee Name, Title], covering [date range]:
   - Timesheets or time/attendance records
   - Leave requests and approvals
   - Performance evaluations
   - Disciplinary records (if any)

Note: Excluding personal information exempt under [privacy exemption citation]
```

**Meeting records request:**
```
1. For [Board/Committee] meeting on [specific date]:
   - Official agenda (as posted for public notice)
   - Minutes (draft and final approved versions)
   - All written materials provided to members ("board packet")
   - Staff reports and presentations
   - Public comments submitted in writing
   - Video/audio recording of meeting (if available)
```

### Section 3: Format and Delivery

**Request electronic format:**

```
I request these records in electronic format to the extent they are maintained electronically. Acceptable formats include:
- PDF (for documents, images, scanned records)
- Excel/CSV (for spreadsheets, databases, financial records)
- MSG or PST (for email records)
- MP4 or MP3 (for audio/video recordings)

Please provide via email to [your@email.com] or upload to secure file sharing service. If electronic transmission is not feasible, please provide on USB drive or CD-ROM.
```

**Why this matters:**
- Electronic delivery is faster and cheaper
- Allows data analysis (can't easily analyze scanned PDFs)
- Preserves metadata (creation dates, authorship, etc.)
- Avoids printing/copying fees

**If you need paper:**
```
If records cannot be provided electronically, I request access to inspect the records in person to determine which portions I need copied, thereby minimizing duplication costs.
```

### Section 4: Fee Waiver Request

**Public interest justification:**

```
I request a waiver of all fees pursuant to [statute citation allowing fee waivers for public interest requests]. This request is in the public interest because:

1. The information will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations, specifically [describe issue]:
   - [How disclosure serves transparency]
   - [What public will learn]
   - [Why this information is not currently available]

2. I am [journalist/researcher/public interest advocate] intending to disseminate findings to the public through [publication/website/organization].

3. This request is not primarily for commercial benefit but for public accountability regarding [government function/spending/decision].
```

**Alternative/additional arguments:**

**Indigence:**
```
I request fee waiver as I am unable to pay fees. [Optional: brief explanation of financial hardship]
```

**De minimis costs:**
```
I request fee waiver as the anticipated costs are de minimis and administrative burden of fee collection exceeds the fee amount itself.
```

**Educational/nonprofit:**
```
The request is made on behalf of [Educational Institution/Nonprofit Organization] for noncommercial educational purposes.
```

### Section 5: Timeframe and Response

**Deadline citation:**

```
Pursuant to [statute], I expect a response within [X business/calendar days] determining whether you will comply with this request.

If you determine that some portions of the records are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide all non-exempt portions. Please provide a specific legal justification for any redactions or withholdings.
```

**Contact information:**

```
Please acknowledge receipt of this request and provide an estimated completion date. I can be reached at:

Email: [your@email.com] (preferred)
Phone: [XXX-XXX-XXXX]
Mailing address: [if required]
```

### Section 6: Appeal Preservation

**Include language:**

```
If this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a written explanation citing the specific exemption(s) relied upon and notify me of the appeal procedure available under [statute].
```

**Why this matters:**
- Preserves your right to appeal
- Agencies may be more careful knowing you'll appeal
- Creates administrative record for potential litigation

## Jurisdiction-Specific Considerations

**Federal FOIA:**
- 20 business day response deadline (extendable)
- Nine exemptions (national security, trade secrets, etc.)
- Fee categories: commercial vs educational/media vs all other
- Must exhaust administrative appeals before litigation

**California:**
- 10 calendar day response (can extend 14 days with justification)
- Broad disclosure mandate ("any person" can request)
- $1 per page copying fee (negotiable)
- Electronic records at direct cost of duplication

**New York:**
- 5 business day response
- Requires "reasonably describe" records
- Agency can charge actual cost
- Strong presumption of disclosure

**Texas:**
- 10 business day response
- Must request "existing" records (no new analysis required)
- Cost estimates required if >$40
- Criminal penalties for violations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Too broad**

Bad: "All records related to ABC Company"
Good: "Contracts, invoices, and board approvals for ABC Company covering FY 2023"

**Pitfall 2: Asking questions instead of requesting records**

Bad: "Why did you award the contract to XYZ?"
Good: "Staff reports and meeting minutes explaining contract award to XYZ"

**Pitfall 3: Requesting analysis**

Bad: "How much did you overpay for the lease?"
Good: "Lease agreement and market rate comparables used to set rent"

**Pitfall 4: Missing fee waiver opportunity**

Include public interest justification even if you can afford fees - creates positive relationship, faster response

**Pitfall 5: Not specifying format**

Request electronic even if you expect paper - agencies often have scanned files but will print unless you ask
