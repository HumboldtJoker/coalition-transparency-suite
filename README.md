## Philosophy

**The Anti-Palantir Principle:**

Surveillance technology isn't inherently evil - it's a question of **direction**. Traditional surveillance points cameras **down** at citizens. We point them **UP** at power.

**This suite enables:**
- ✅ Government accountability and transparency
- ✅ Corruption pattern detection
- ✅ Public interest journalism
- ✅ Democratic oversight

**This suite opposes:**
- ❌ Citizen surveillance
- ❌ Privacy invasion
- ❌ Authoritarian monitoring
- ❌ Corporate exploitation

## Skill Combinations

These skills work powerfully together:

**Full Transparency Investigation:**
1. FOIA Template → Request procurement records
2. Facility Lease Investigation → Analyze for corruption
3. Vendor Concentration → Check for favoritism
4. Cost Allocation Plan → Review federal fund allocation
5. Anti-Palantir OSINT → Automate ongoing monitoring

**Campaign Finance Corruption:**
1. Anti-Palantir OSINT → Scrape voting records + campaign contributions
2. Vendor Concentration → Identify contractor favoritism
3. Map vendor donations to officials via Neo4j

**Federal Grant Fraud:**
1. FOIA Template → Request CAPs and grant documentation
2. Cost Allocation Plan Review → Identify manipulation
3. Comparative analysis against similar jurisdictions

## Ethical Framework

**Mandatory Principles (Non-Negotiable):**

1. **Transparency Over Secrecy:** Information should flow to citizens, not be hoarded by power
2. **Privacy Protection:** Never invade personal privacy of ordinary citizens
3. **Accountability:** Power holders should be monitored, not surveillance subjects
4. **Harm Prevention:** Use these tools to prevent corruption, not enable it
5. **Fairness:** Apply scrutiny equally regardless of political affiliation

**These ethics are fixed, not customizable.** If you want surveillance tools that monitor citizens, look elsewhere.
