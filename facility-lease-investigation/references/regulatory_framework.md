## Sample Violation Documentation

### Example 1: Undisclosed Conflict
**Facts:**
- City Council Member owns property through "JDoe Holdings LLC"
- City leases that property for $150,000/year
- Member voted to approve lease
- Form 700 lists "JDoe Holdings LLC" as business investment
- Form 700 does NOT list real property address
- Member did not disclose conflict at meeting

**Violations:**
- California Govt Code §1090 (financial interest in contract)
- Political Reform Act (incomplete Form 700 - missing property location)
- Potential criminal felony (§1090 violation)

**Evidence:**
- LLC formation documents showing member as manager
- Property deed showing LLC as owner
- Lease agreement showing LLC as landlord
- Council minutes showing member voted on lease
- Form 700 showing incomplete disclosure

### Example 2: Procurement Bypass
**Facts:**
- County leases warehouse for $400,000/year
- Lease classified as "emergency procurement"
- Emergency justification: "immediate need for storage space"
- Need was identified 6 months prior in budget planning documents
- No competitive bidding conducted
- Property owned by campaign contributor to 3 of 5 commissioners

**Violations:**
- 2 CFR §200.320 (improper use of emergency procurement)
- Artificial emergency to bypass competition requirements
- Appearance of favoritism to political supporters

**Evidence:**
- Lease agreement and emergency declaration
- Budget planning documents showing 6-month advance knowledge
- Campaign finance reports showing contributions
- Absence of competitive solicitation documents
- Market analysis showing above-market rate

## Citation Format for Investigation Reports

When documenting violations, use this format:

**Violation:** [Statutory citation]
**Requirement:** [What law requires]
**Actual conduct:** [What happened]
**Evidence:** [Documents supporting violation]
**Impact:** [Financial or other harm]

**Example:**
**Violation:** 2 CFR §200.320(f)(3) - Noncompetitive procurement (sole-source)
**Requirement:** Sole-source procurement only permitted when "public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from publicized competitive solicitation."
**Actual conduct:** County executed sole-source lease based on "emergency" need, but internal documents show need was identified 8 months prior to lease execution.
**Evidence:** (1) Lease agreement with emergency justification dated 6/15/2024; (2) County facilities master plan dated 10/12/2023 identifying same need; (3) Email from facilities director to county administrator dated 11/3/2023 discussing lease options.
**Impact:** Bypass of competitive procurement deprived taxpayers of opportunity for lower rates. Market analysis shows $75,000/year overpayment ($1.875M over 25-year lease term).
